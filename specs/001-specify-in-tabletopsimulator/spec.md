# Feature Specification: TTS Bulk Card Image Merge API

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-in-tabletopsimulator`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/specify In TableTopSimulator (hereafter abbreviated as TTS), it is possible to bulk import card images by preparing a large image that combines 70 cards in a grid of 7 rows by 10 columns. This time, we will create an API server that performs this merging automatically.

We are assuming the following workflow:

- Receive a JSON containing the UUID and URL of up to 70 images.
- If the UUID matches an image that has already been downloaded, use that cached image. If it does not match, download the image from the provided URL and save it to the cache (S3 or similar is assumed).
- Return the combined image to the client."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
   ‚Üí Capture UX patterns, accessibility expectations, and performance targets; mark [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] when unspecified
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Include accessibility notes and measurable performance expectations per scenario
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- üéØ Document UX patterns, accessibility commitments, and performance targets clearly

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A deck designer using TTS submits up to 70 card art assets via a request payload and receives a single combined image laid out in the TTS-compatible 7√ó10 grid so they can import the deck in one action.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a request containing 70 valid image UUID+URL pairs, **When** the user submits the request, **Then** the system responds within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target latency for image merge completion] with a downloadable merged image that preserves the original card order and delivers at least the minimum resolution TTS requires.
2. **Given** a request where some UUIDs correspond to previously cached images, **When** the user submits the request, **Then** the system reuses cached assets without refetching them, logs the cache hits, and returns a merged image along with a response field indicating which assets were cached for traceability.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when fewer than 70 cards are supplied‚Äîshould the grid include empty slots or reflow the layout? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: padding behavior for partial decks]
- How does the system handle unreachable URLs or corrupted image files‚Äîdoes it fail the whole merge or return partial results with warnings? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: error handling policy]
- What limits apply to source image dimensions or file sizes, and how should the system respond when they are exceeded? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: max asset size and validation rules]

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a JSON payload containing up to 70 objects with UUID and source image URL fields.
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve or reuse each referenced image, consulting cache storage first and downloading remote assets only when the UUID is not already cached.
- **FR-003**: System MUST assemble the retrieved images into a single composite laid out in 7 rows by 10 columns, preserving the request order from top-left to bottom-right.
- **FR-004**: System MUST return the merged image to the client in a format compatible with TTS imports and include metadata describing any images that failed to merge.
- **FR-005**: System MUST meet [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance/SLO target for merge throughput and latency] while operating within agreed memory and storage budgets.
- **FR-006**: System MUST record cache hits, misses, and download outcomes to support monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **FR-007**: System MUST expose clear error responses when image retrieval, validation, or composition fails, including actionable messages for the requesting client.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **MergeRequest**: Represents the client submission containing up to 70 card descriptors, requested merge metadata (e.g., deck name), and optional hints about desired output resolution. Requires tracking submission timestamp and requesting user/service ID.
- **CachedAsset**: Captures a single card image stored in cache, identified by UUID, with fields for storage location, checksum, original source URL, cached timestamp, and expiration policy.
- **MergeResult**: Describes the combined image artifact, including download URL, format, pixel dimensions, processing duration, cache hit/miss counts, and any errors or warnings recorded during the operation.
